## üßæ Overview

The project demonstrates the evolution of a 3D robot model through three assignments:

- **Assignment 1 (A1):** Basic robot design with hierarchical modeling.
- **Assignment 2 (A2):** Introduction of surface modeling and mesh viewing.
- **Assignment 3 (A3):** Advanced robot features, including walking, weapon firing, and camera interactivity.

The robot is built using OpenGL and GLUT, with modular code for each body part and functionality.
