CPS 511 Assignment 2
Farbod Jalilfar, Soroush Sadeghian


The main program can run using "main.sh". You can also modify the imports to match your OS. The second program can run using
"view.sh". To run it do "./view {your .obj file}". There are already 2 models model0.obj and model1.obj available.

The first program is missing part 3. We could not get GLEW working proparly on MacOS. Also, the old GLUT in macos does not register mouse wheel movements so we used the + and - buttons to zoom in and out. The zoom is not available in the model viewer. Use button e to export the model in the main program.
